          Hey class! My name is Clinton Bauer and I wanted to show some coding
          to make basic games. I think I understand it well enough to explain it
          to you. I've been playing video games since I can remember (bad or
          good?), but only recently became interested in learning how coding and
          graphics work to make a game. It is cool to see how they are made. I
          can not imagine having millions of lines to go through to debug. I
          barely have a thousand or so and I still get lost in the code when
          trying to find a mistake. This is a project that you follow along with
          made by Brackey's. You can google his video "Godot Beginner Tutorial."
          There you can also build a game like in the examples below. But here
          are some basic commands to some parts of making a simple game. Thanks
          for reading!

          Movement
        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Moving a player is one of the most important parts of making a game.
          From adventure to fighting games, basic 4 way movements (up, down,
          left, right) for 2d games create a bigger world than just what is
          shown on the screen. In example 1, we can see the player move left,
          right and jumping. Much like how html has event listeners for mouse
          clicks, there is a process that waits for keyboard clicks. If the
          player presses "A" then it will make the character move to the left.
          When a space bar key is detected, then it makes the player jump.

            This line of code is the one that detects the "A" and "S" key being

            character left or right. It is possible to reverse the code where a
            player can go left when pressing right. These are how inverted
            controls are made.

              When a character has reached a door or wall, how does the computer

              Colliders is one of the ground works to creating a video game.
              Without colliders, characters will just fall on the screen
              forever. Creating a ground with a collider so the character can
              walk and jump.

              In example 1, you can see that the level is normal without any
              highlights. In example 3, I have turned on the feature to show
              colliders. You can now see that the ground is highlighted in a
              light green. This is the collider that allows the player to stand
              on top. You can see that the 2 trees in the level are not
              highlighted green. The player is able to pass through the trees,
              but not the ground or the placed stones blocking the bridge.

              When the colliders hit each other, how does it know when it has
              hit an enemy or a coin? When objects are created, they are given a
              name so that when the colliders are detected, it can read the name
              of the object and executes the code that matches the name. So if
              the character runs into an enemy, the code will decrease health
              until there is no more health. At that point the character dies
              and gets reset. When the character runs into a coin, the code will
              add plus one to their coin count and make the coin disappear.

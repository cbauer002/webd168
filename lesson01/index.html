      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        I am taking this course to push my boundaries in coding with many
        languages. But taking so many different languages at one time can be so
        confusing when it comes to learning how each language follows their own
        syntax. Sometimes I try to write things like "print something" instead
        of "console.log." Same command for different languages. I am still
        working on remembering all the different elements and how to use them. HTML isn't my strong suit so I hope to better myself with this course.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        I am pretty lazy when it comes to doing other things during school time.
        A lot of brain power goes into learning HTML and javascript. But when it
        is snow season, I love to go snowboarding. Something about sliding on
        snow for hours while looking at the mountain can cleanse the soul. But
        here are the other hobbies I love doing too.

        This is a picture of my 2 cats, Perry and Momo (orange). This was when I
        was living in Denver for a little bit. The winters are quite cold and
        whats the best way to stay warm? Nothing like cuddling right next to the
        fireplace.
